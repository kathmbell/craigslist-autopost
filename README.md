Roebot automatically posts information about reproductive healthcare access to [Craiglist](https://www.craigslist.org) in [US locations where abortion has been restricted or outlawed](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/abortion-access-tool/US).

## Background
In 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled in [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) that the constitution guarantees the right to terminate a pregnancy. In the decades since, many states and localities have passed restrictions that nearly or effectively made abortion impossible, but an outright ban has not been possible.

On June 24, 2022, the [Supreme Court reversed its decision in Roe](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-overturned-supreme-court.html). As a result, states and lower governments that wanted to completely outlaw abortion can do so. This means that there is a patchwork of abortion regulations across the country, ranging from very liberal, to very restricted, to complete bans.

Roebot posts information about how to legally obtain reproductive healthcare in those places where abortion is restricted or banned.
